Abstract: Numerical simulations are used to model and predict the impact of tsunamis. By specifying plausible slip patterns near known fault lines, realistic earthquakes and the tsunamis they produce can be simulated. The water displaced by simulated earthquakes can be tracked to determine the degree of inland flooding, known as inundation. By estimating the probability of occurrence of these simulated tsunamis and considering many sources, the probability and degree of inundation can be estimated for every point in the landscape, giving rise to a hazard map. Visualizing hazard maps is difficult for several reasons: first, the probability of each simulated event must be estimated; second, the hazard maps are generated from a limited pool of simulated events, and so may not account for the worst or most exotic tsunamis; and third, the resultant hazard maps specify a complex hazard function at every point, which describes probability of inundation at every depth. To effectively communicate the dangers and potential impacts of tsunamis to the general public, we employ effective and interactive design techniques to give users an enhanced understanding of this complex data. For the region in question, we display contour plots of inundation level for fixed probabilities, and allow the user to manipulate the probability to see how inundation changes over the landscape. Using small multiples, we present the user with an overview of the inundation from a sample of individual simulations that show the possible variety of outcomes over separate events.
