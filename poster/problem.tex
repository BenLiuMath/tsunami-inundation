	Our project seeks to address the following problems:
	\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=2cm]
		\item Hazard maps and the data used to produce them contain multiple sources of uncertainty. It is challenging to communicate this uncertainty alongside or as part of hazard maps in an intuitive way.
		\item Hazard maps are inherently complex and nuanced and can therefore be difficult for non-experts to decipher.
	\end{enumerate}
